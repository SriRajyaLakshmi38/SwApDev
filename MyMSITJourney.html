        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm from Chilakaluripet and aspires to be a Data Scientist.</p>
        <h3>Why I joined MSIT?</h3>
        <p> MSIT is a PG program which allows us to learn coding which helps to be placed in software companies with good package. </p>
        <p> I had choosen MSIT because I can become a Data Scientist with the required skills in a good company.</p>
        <p> MSIT enabled me to learn</p>
        
        <uo>
            <li>Working by myself by exploring the concepts</li>
            <li>To learn Elegant coding</li>
            <li>To improve Personal and Professional skills</li>
